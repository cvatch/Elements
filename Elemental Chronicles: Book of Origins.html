        <h2>The First Dawn (Early Primordial Era)</h2>
        <p>In the beginning, there was only the Void, until the moment of the Great Explosion shattered the nothingness into being. From this cosmic birth emerged only two elements: <a href="element/hydrogen.html">Hydrogen</a> and <a href="element/helium.html">Helium</a>. These simplest of elements would reign alone for eons, until the birth of the first stars.</p>

        <p>With these primal elements came the <a href="character/PrimusPage.html">Star Lords</a> - <a href="character/PrimusPage.html">Primus</a> and <a href="character/HelionPage.html">Helion</a>, beings of pure energy and consciousness. Unlike the <a href="character/ElementalDeities.html">Elemental Deities</a> who would come later, the Star Lords were direct manifestations of the universe's fundamental forces, born in the first moments of existence.</p>

        <p><a href="character/PrimusPage.html">Primus</a>, the First Star, gathered the scattered essence of Hydrogen and forged the <a href="object/HydrogenOrbPage.html">Hydrogen Orb</a>, the first artifact of power. This creation established the First Path of artifact creation - Divine Forging, where cosmic beings of sufficient power could shape elemental essence directly.</p>

        <p>Star Lord <a href="character/HelionPage.html">Helion</a>, witnessing this act of creation, sought to bring stability to the chaos. Working with the newly emerged <a href="character/CosmicSmithPage.html">Cosmic Smiths</a> - beings born from the interaction between matter and energy - Helion created the <a href="object/HeliumHeartPage.html">Helium Heart</a>. This collaboration established the Second Path of artifact creation - Cosmic Collaboration, combining divine will with cosmic craftsmanship.</p>

        <h2>The Great Forging (Mid Primordial Era)</h2>
        <p>As the first stars aged and their cores began to compress, the intense pressure and heat forged the first new elements beyond the primordial two. This process began with Lithium, followed by Beryllium, and then Carbon. Each new element emerged in sequence, following the strict laws of stellar nucleosynthesis.</p>

        <p>The formation of <a href="object/CarbonRelicPage.html">Carbon</a> marked a crucial milestone. Unlike the divine creation of early artifacts, the <a href="object/CarbonRelicPage.html">Carbon Relic</a> formed spontaneously within a dying star's core through the Third Path of artifact creation - Elemental Coalescence. This natural process occurred when sufficient concentrations of pure elemental essence accumulated under specific cosmic conditions.</p>

        <p>It was during this era that the first <a href="character/ElementalDeities.html">Elemental Deities</a> began to manifest, each born from their element's pure essence. Unlike the Star Lords, these deities were bound to their specific elements and could only create artifacts through established Paths of Creation. The hierarchy was clear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="character/StarLordPage.html">Star Lords</a> (Primal Beings)
                <ul>
                    <li>Could create artifacts alone</li>
                    <li>Could establish new cosmic laws</li>
                    <li>Existed beyond elemental limitations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="character/CosmicSmithPage.html">Cosmic Smiths/Artisans</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Could shape elemental essence</li>
                    <li>Required collaboration for artifact creation</li>
                    <li>Understood the fundamental principles of creation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="character/ElementalDeities.html">Elemental Deities</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bound to their specific elements</li>
                    <li>Required either Cosmic Smith collaboration or natural Coalescence for artifact creation</li>
                    <li>Governed their elemental domains</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section id="aegis-order">
        <h2>The Founding of the Aegis Order</h2>
        <p>Recognizing the need for balance as new elements and artifacts emerged, the Star Lords established the <a href="organization/AegisOrder.html">Aegis Order</a>. The Order's structure was carefully defined:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Three Principal Guardians:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="character/AegisOfTheNoble.html">Aegis of the Noble</a> (oversees noble gas elements and artifacts)</li>
                    <li><a href="character/AegisOfTheMetallic.html">Aegis of the Metallic</a> (oversees metallic elements and artifacts)</li>
                    <li><a href="character/AegisOfTheVolatile.html">Aegis of the Volatile</a> (oversees reactive elements and artifacts)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Powers and Limitations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Could sense artifacts within their domain</li>
            <li>Could travel through their elemental medium</li>
            <li>Could not create artifacts themselves</li>
            <li>Limited to governing their assigned elemental group</li>
            <li>Terms of service lasted one cosmic cycle (birth to death of a major star)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Succession Protocol:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Aegis chosen by their predecessor</li>
            <li>Power transferred through the Ritual of Elemental Succession</li>
            <li>New Aegis inherits memories of artifacts but not personal experiences</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="elemental-rise">
        <h2>The Elemental Rise (Late Primordial Era)</h2>
        <p>The death of the first massive stars - supernovas of unimaginable power - scattered heavier elements across the cosmos. Each new element followed strict rules of formation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Light elements (up to Iron) formed in stellar cores</li>
            <li>Heavy elements formed only in supernovas</li>
            <li>Each element required its predecessors to exist first</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Artifact Creation Rules:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Divine Forging: Limited to Star Lords and First Era artifacts</li>
            <li>Cosmic Collaboration: Required deity + Cosmic Smith/Artisan</li>
            <li>Elemental Coalescence: Natural formation under specific conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Documentation Protocol:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each artifact's creation method recorded in the Cosmic Registry</li>
            <li><a href="organization/AegisOrder.html">Aegis Order</a> maintains records of all known artifacts</li>
            <li>Clear chain of custody established for each artifact</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Artifact Classification System:</strong></p>
        <p>To prevent future inconsistencies, all artifacts were classified by their origin:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Era Artifacts:</strong> Created by Star Lords (e.g., <a href="object/HydrogenOrbPage.html">Hydrogen Orb</a>, <a href="object/HeliumHeartPage.html">Helium Heart</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborated Artifacts:</strong> Created through Cosmic Collaboration (e.g., <a href="object/CrystalOfKrypton.html">Crystal of Krypton</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Coalesced Artifacts:</strong> Formed naturally through Elemental Coalescence (e.g., <a href="object/CarbonRelicPage.html">Carbon Relic</a>, Actinium Sword)</li>
        </ul>
