    <!-- History Section -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Helium was first discovered in the Sun by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Johnstone_Stoney" target="_blank">George Johnstone Stoney</a> in 1868, during a solar eclipse. It was later isolated on Earth by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_Thornton" target="_blank">William Gilbert Thornton</a> in 1895.</p>
        <p>Helium’s presence in stars was crucial in understanding stellar nuclear fusion, as it is a byproduct of the fusion process that powers stars.</p>
