        <p>Primus is a towering, godlike figure, embodying the very essence of the universe’s creation. His form is radiant, glowing with the light of the stars, and he carries the energy of the primordial explosion that birthed the cosmos. Primus is a force of creation and destruction, maintaining the balance between the birth of stars and their eventual death. He stands as the first of the Star Lords and the origin of all that is.</p>

    <!-- History Section -->
    <section id="history">
        <h2>Background and History</h2>
        <p>Primus, the First Star, is considered the progenitor of all elemental life. Born from the Great Explosion, he is said to have forged the first elements from pure cosmic energy. Primus shaped the first hydrogen particles, which began the chain of events that would lead to the creation of all other elements. He is revered as a creator and a protector of cosmic order, guiding the formation of galaxies and stellar systems.</p>
        <p>His creation of the <a href="[[Hydrogen Orb - Object Page]]">Hydrogen Orb</a> marked the beginning of the cosmic order, setting the foundation for the art of Divine Forging, where powerful cosmic beings could manipulate elemental essence.</p>
